## [NEWS]
I renamed this game/project from **PTXO** to **Flux Takedown** because I don't like the fact that PTXO ressembles OTXO a lot and I don't want the game to be called a rip-off, I simply was inspired by OTXO and Tron:Legacy to make this project, so I renamed it something more original and gives a sci-fi gameplay feel to it. (did i cook ?)
